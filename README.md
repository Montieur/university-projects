# University projects

### This is where you can check out most of my projects I made for my university courses. Most, because I didn't want to litter this repo with some introductory or completely trivial tasks. I also didn't mention any of my group projects in here, stealing credit for my colleagues' work doesn't really feel right.


##### also work on repo not finished, I still have to submit at least two more projects, will update when they're done

<br>

### Here are short summaries of my projects (in alphabetical order): 
<br>

## Advertisements website
##### Made with: Python / Django
Simple site which allows publishing advertisements about cars without having to log in.
<br>

## Audio mixer
##### Made with: C# / .NET,  NAudio library
My most advanced project so far. This app offers a few simple audio file editing tools: 
- editing up to three audio tracks at a time, ability to merge them all into one file
- cutting from both ends of the track
- duplicating the length of the track (essentialy one-time loop, can be used indefinitely for more loops)
- fading in (from silence to full volume)
- volume change
- delaying the track (makes the track start playing at a given point in time)

## Audio player
##### Made with: C# / .NET, NAudio library
Simple audio file player, supports saving playlists, I'm happy with how the UI came out.
<br>

## Checkers
##### Made with: C# / .NET
My latest project, a game of checkers. Probably the best thing to look at if you want to judge me based on my code-writing habits.

## Familiada
##### Made with: Java
One of my first projects. It's basically a Familiada (Polish Family Feud equivalent) simulator. It wasn't meant for uni, but rather for my brother's wedding! I think it's too small to be in it's own repo, but I was really proud of it back then, so I just HAD to put it somewhere. Unfortunately, questions and answers are hard-coded (as I said, one of my firsts (-_-') ), but I have plans to write it again so more people could enjoy this cool thing!
<br>

## Forum
##### Made with: Python / Django
Forum (message board) website, supports registration, moderators and posts editing!
<br>

## Image editor
##### Made with: C# / .NET, FIP library
Kind of like MS Paint with a few features from GIMP.
<br>

## Image viewer
##### Made with: C# / .NET
Image viewer with some basic image viewer options like rotation and zooming.
<br>

## Sudoku game
##### Made with: JavaScript / Flask
A website where you can play sudoku! Unfortunately,  I didn't write the algorithm used to generate numbers for valid sudoku grid, I used one from https://www.101computing.net/ <br>
If I were doing it now, I would simply call some sudoku grid serving API, instead of setting one up myself (-_-') <br>
Oh well, at least it works offline!
<br>

## Video player
##### Made with: C# / .NET
More of an UI for video player that Windows library provides rather than actual video player.
